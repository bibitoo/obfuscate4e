  <h1>Excluding classes or packages from obfuscation</h1>

<p>Obfuscate4e detects exported packages and and writes the corresponding obfuscation 
exclusion statements automatically into the file <em>proguard.cfg</em> at your 
plugin's root directory.</p>

<p>Starting from version 0.7 of <em>obfuscate4e</em> all classes references from plugin
extensions (in <em>plugin.xml</em>) are automatically inserted into the obfuscator 
exclusion list. Thus the obfuscate4e configuration should be updated whenever a new extension
is added to the plugin.<br/>
<em>Remark: This feature works only on Eclipse 3.4 (there seems to be a bug or non-implemented
feature in Eclipse 3.2 and 3.3)</em></p>

<p>Of course you can add custom exclusion statements by hand. For instance If a class gets
instantiated via reflection or is referenced by name in any other way, it has to be excluded.</p>
